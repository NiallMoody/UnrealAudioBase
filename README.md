# UnrealAudioBase
A simple third person puzzle project intended as a base for exploring audio implementation in Unreal.

This project was created as a base for students to explore audio implementation in Unreal. I currently use it in labs for my **CMP407: Audio Programming** module at [Abertay University](https://www.abertay.ac.uk/).

As it is intended as a base for audio implementation, it features the following:

- Different surfaces to walk on/in (concrete, grass, water)
- Different shapes and sizes of enclosed spaces (with expectations of their own acoustic characteristics, i.e. reverb)
- Unreal's default third-person model for timeline-based footstep triggering
- A small variety of buttons and triggers
- A small pool of water for experimenting with sonic underwater effects

Note that the 'puzzles' are not particularly challenging. This may change in future, see the [ToDo list](https://github.com/NiallMoody/UnrealAudioBase/blob/main/ToDo.md).
